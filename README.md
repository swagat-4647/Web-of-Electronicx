# Web-of-Electronicx
## PHP based E-Commerce and Third Party Sale-Purchase Platform for B.Tech Semester 3
WEB OF ELECTRONICX is an E-Commerce platform across which a sell and purchase of new electronic components is possible. The uniqueness of the website is that, it will help us to buy electronic components not available in local market or anywhere in that region and also not on other E-commerce platforms.
Unavailability of electronic components in particular region due to multiple reasons makes it difficult for engineer, scientist or any other consumer difficult to work on their projects. Most of the customized products designed by the company are not available on online platforms or in local market. Thus in such cases it becomes difficult for user to fulfil the project requirement, as he/she is not able to get that product. 
Through this website, I connected few local vendors of regions where the manufacturer of the components are situated and the consumers. As per the requirement of new product, local vendors situated at different places could check the availability of the product at there region and hence would provide consumer with price including there commission and delivery charges. To which consumer can respond either by buying it or waiting for others to post the price details.
To implement the same PHP is used as backend and frontend is designed using HTML CSS and JavaScript. The Website is fuly resposnisve. The products are categorized mainly into 5 catgories.
1. Display and Capture Devices: Section for Selling Cameras and Display from multiple global vendors.
2. PCB: Customized PCB desgined readily available for people can be sold along with manufacturing requests by providing designs to the manufacturers.
3. Radio Receivers and Transmitters: Here governement regulated communication systems can be sold or purchased.
4. Semiconductor Devices: Here IC that are not available in one particular region can be found out.
5. Storage Batteries: Here battries of multiple types can be sold or purchased.
6. Inquiry: Section that deals with requesting customized products to all sellers. THis request gets displayed to user at its dashboard page when logged in.
